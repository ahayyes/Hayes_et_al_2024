Sequence data is deposited at ENA XXX
Plating and qPCR data is deposited here as part of this repository.

# Outline 
This repository contains the datasets, analyses, and figures for the paper 'Antimicrobial effects, and selection for AMR by non-antibiotic drugs on bacterial communities'. The code present can recreate all figures and tables. The raw sequencing data for the metagenomics analyses are available at XXX. The code for running the bioinformatics pipelines (ARGs-OAP, Bacmet, MetaPhlAn) are not present here, but are available upon request. 

This repository contains the qPCR and plating datasets, all analyses (including for sequence data) and figures of the above-mentioned paper. It can recreate all figures in both the main text and the supplement.
