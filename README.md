# Outline 
This repository contains the datasets, analyses, and figures for the paper XXX. The code present can recreate all figures and tables. The raw sequencing data for the metagenomics analyses are available at XXX. The code for running the bioinformatics pipelines (ARGs-OAP, Bacmet, MetaPhlAn) are not present here, but are available upon request. 


This repository contains the final datasets, analyses and figures of the above-mentioned paper. It can recreate all figures and tables in both the main text and the supplement apart from Tables 1 and 2.

The code for running the bioinformatics pipelines for the amplicon 16S sequencing and the isolate whole genome sequencing are not included in the repository. These are available upon request. The raw sequencing data (for the 16S sequencing) and the genome assemblies (isolate WGS) are available on ENA here. They can be downloaded using enaBrowserTools (other tools are likely available).
